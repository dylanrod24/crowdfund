# crowdfund

A crowdfund dapp with a frontend built with ReactJS, Next.js and Web3. It allows users create campaigns to be crowdfunded. In order for
a campaign manager to withdraw the funds, contributors to that campaign must approve the request for the funds
to be withdrawn and sent to the requested address.
